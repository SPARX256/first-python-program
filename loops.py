#loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times      
#there are two primary types of loops = [1] while loops and for loops.
#nesting is putting a block of code inside another block of code


# for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuples, dict, string or range)

# Syntax:
# for variable in sequence:
      # statements

# looping through a list
# fruits = ["a", "b", "c",]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

#looping through a string
# text = "Python"
# for char in text:
#     print(char)
